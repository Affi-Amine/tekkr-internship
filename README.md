# Tekkr Full Stack Hiring Challenge

_ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this full stack hiring challenge! âœ¨_

Please don't spend much more than 3 hours solving this challenge -> if you find yourself spending more time, please stop and submit what you have.

## Instructions

The `web` directory contains all code for the frontend React application.
The `server` directory contains all code for the backend application based on [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/).

To get started:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` in both directories to install dependencies. 
3. Then, run `npm start` in both directories to start the backend and the frontend (they will auto-refresh as you change the code). The frontend runs on port 3000, backend on port 8000.

> You can add as many files and endpoints as you want, try to avoid changing existing code unless necessary.
> You can also add dependencies as needed.

### Submission
Once you are done, please push your code to a public GitHub repository and send us the link.

## Your Job

#### Features to Implement
Take the existing app and add the following features:
1. Implement the dummy chat window. Typed messages should be sent to the backend and handled by an LLM of your choice (out of Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic).
   - The user must be able to start a new chat by using the "New Chat" button.
   - New chats should show up in the sidebar (the name doesn't matter) and must be selectable.
   - When sending a message, there should be a loading indicator, then the response from the LLM should be displayed in the chat window.
2. Implement an inline-preview for project plans.
    - When the user requests a "project plan" from the LLM, there should be an inline preview of the plan in the chat window.
    - The preview should look like the in following image (the icons can be ignored, sections should be expandable/collapsible).
    - It must be possible for the plan to appear in the middle of a message (not just at the end or beginning).

> ðŸ‘‰ The project plan consists of a variable number of "workstreams" (each with a title and description) that then contain a variable number of "deliverables" (also each with a title and description).

#### Additional Requirements
- When reloading the page, the chat history must be preserved and the same chat must be selected as before the reload.
- Errors should be handled gracefully
- Use `shadcn/ui` components (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).
- Use React Query for interactions with the backend (https://tanstack.com/query/latest).
- It should be very easy for another developer to replace the LLM you used with another one (e.g. from OpenAI to Anthropic).

#### Out of scope
- There's no need to persist anything in the backend, in-memory storage is fine.
- Responsiveness or any other optimization for mobile devices is not required.
- It is fine to assume there is only one user (no need for authentication or any sort of user context handling)
- No need to write tests
